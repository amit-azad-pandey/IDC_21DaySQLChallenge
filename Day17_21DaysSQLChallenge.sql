-- Practice Questions:
-- 1. Show each patient with their service's average satisfaction as an additional column.
SELECT p.patient_id, p.name AS patienct_name, 
p.service, p.satisfaction AS patient_satisfaction,
(SELECT ROUND(AVG(sw.patient_satisfaction),2)
FROM services_weekly sw
WHERE p.service = sw.service GROUP BY service) AS avg_satisfaction
FROM patients p;

-- 2. Create a derived table of service statistics and query from it.
SELECT sw.week, sw.month, sw.patients_admitted, ss.staff_assigned, ss.staff_present, sw.staff_morale, sw.service
FROM services_weekly sw INNER JOIN (  
    SELECT week, service, COUNT(staff_id) AS staff_assigned, SUM(CASE WHEN present = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS staff_present
    FROM staff_schedule
    GROUP BY week, service
) ss ON ss.week = sw.week AND ss.service = sw.service;


-- 3. Display staff with their service's total patient count as a calculated field.
SELECT ss.week, ss.staff_name, ss.role, ss.service, 
    (
        SELECT COUNT(p.patient_id)
        FROM patients p
        WHERE DATEPART(WEEK, p.arrival_date) = ss.week
    ) AS patients_count
FROM staff_schedule ss
ORDER BY ss.week;

-- Daily Challenge:
-- Question: Create a report showing each service with: service name, total patients admitted, the difference between their total admissions and the average admissions across all services, and a rank indicator ('Above Average', 'Average', 'Below Average'). Order by total patients admitted descending.
SELECT svc.service AS service_name,
svc.total_patients AS total_patients_admitted,
ROUND(svc.total_patients - avg_table.avg_patients, 2) 
AS difference_between_total_and_avg,
CASE
WHEN svc.total_patients > avg_table.avg_patients THEN 'Above Average'
WHEN svc.total_patients = avg_table.avg_patients THEN 'Average'
ELSE 'Below Average'
END AS rank_indicator
FROM(
SELECT service, SUM(patients_admitted) AS total_patients
FROM services_weekly
GROUP BY service
) AS svc,
( SELECT AVG(total_patients) AS avg_patients
FROM (
SELECT SUM(patients_admitted) AS total_patients
FROM services_weekly
GROUP BY service
) AS inner_avg
) AS avg_table
ORDER BY svc.total_patients DESC;

-- Practice Questions:
-- 1. Find all weeks in services_weekly where no special event occurred.
SELECT DISTINCT week, event
FROM services_weekly
WHERE event IS NULL OR event = 'none'
ORDER BY week;

-- 2. Count how many records have null or empty event values.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_empty_events
FROM services_weekly
WHERE event IS NULL OR event = '';

-- 3. List all services that had at least one week with a special event.
SELECT service,
COUNT(*) AS no_of_weeks
FROM services_weekly
WHERE event IS NOT NULL AND event != '' AND event != 'none'
GROUP BY service;

-- Daily Challenge:
-- Question: Analyze the event impact by comparing weeks with events vs weeks without events. Show: event status ('With Event' or 'No Event'), count of weeks, average patient satisfaction, and average staff morale. Order by average patient satisfaction descending.
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN event IS NOT NULL AND event <> '' AND event <> 'none'
            THEN 'With Event'
        ELSE 'No Event'
    END AS event_status,
    COUNT(*) AS week_count,
    ROUND(AVG(patient_satisfaction), 2) AS avg_patient_satisfaction,
    ROUND(AVG(staff_morale), 2) AS avg_staff_morale
FROM services_weekly
GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN event IS NOT NULL AND event <> '' AND event <> 'none'
            THEN 'With Event'
        ELSE 'No Event'
    END
ORDER BY AVG(patient_satisfaction) DESC;
